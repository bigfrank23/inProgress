                  In 1950s, the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC) arrived in
                  western Nigeria through Benin, its founder was Oshoffa. The
                  church made so much in-road into every strata of the society.
                  A member of Cherubim and Seraphim, Pa Josiah Akindayomi pulled
                  out to form the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG),
                  reputed to be the fastest growing denomination in the world
                  with a church almost in every five minutes walking and driving
                  distance in Nigeria and Overseas respectively. This is largely
                  due to the visionary leadership of its current general
                  overseer Pastor Enoch Adeboye.{" "}

                  By 1960s- 1970s, the movement spread to campuses and secondary
                  schools in the nation in a sweeping revival that saved
                  thousands of students. The scripture union is credited with
                  this sweeping revival that birthed many independent churches.
                  Africa’s finest Pentecostal preacher, Arch Bishop Benson
                  Idahosa is the leader of this movement that focused on faith
                  and prosperity largely because of the despicable financial
                  state of the then Pentecostals. Idahosa, it was, who opened a
                  new vista of opportunities of Pentecostalism in Nigeria,
                  drawing mammoth crowd with stupendous healing and miracle
                  following. In 1972, he founded the Church of God Mission
                  International followed by the Deeper Life Bible Church in 1975
                  by Pastor Williams Kumuyi.{" "}
