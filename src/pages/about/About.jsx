                        The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, inaugurated on 14th of November, 1986 in Lagos,
                         is the national body which binds all Christian churches, organizations and believers
                          who believe, experience, practice and cherish the Pentecostal experience as found and
                           described in Acts 2:4. These are believers who accepted as valid for today the baptism
                            of the Holy Spirit, with the physical initial evidence of speaking in other tongues
                             as it was spoken of those who experienced same in the Bible days. (Acts 10:45-47).
                        In addition, they are those who accepted the evangelical truth of justification by faith
                         as propounded by Martin Luther, the Westley, the experience of holiness as preached by
                          John Westley and the heat of evangelistic zeal of fire and blood by William Booth of the Salvation Army.
                        It is not a union of churches brought together for a central administration and control;
                         rather it a body of believers having identical unity of purpose and corporation in agreed programs.
